# enhanced_perm
Solved the problem of diffusion of a fluid across a medium whose permeability increases as a function of the pore-pressure. Such increase in permeability has been seen within crustal rocks in laboratory experiments(Yilmaz et al., 1994) and such increase in permeability is observed to be exponential with respect to the effective pressure and thus the pore pressure itself.
